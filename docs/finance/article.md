# Financial Resources for Older Adults in the Waterloo Region

According to the [2016 Cencus Bulletin](https://www.regionofwaterloo.ca/en/resources/Census/Census-Bulletin-1-Population-Age-and-Sex-access.pdf) for the Waterloo Region, 1 in 7 individuals in the region was above 65 years old. The number of older adults are slowing increasing in the region and so the region provides many resources to help them in whatever they need. In particular, there are a vast variety of financial resources available to older adults.

The financial information is applicable to adults that are either below 65 or above 65 years of age. Financial resources are different for each age group for programs like Canadian Pension Plan(CPP), Canada Old Age Security (OAS), and prescriptions. 

Canadian Pension Plans for older adults above the age of 65 years old, have the opportunity to receive their full CPP Retirement Pension, and also get their increased Post-Retirement Benefit if they wait to claim CPP at the age of 70. For older adults between the age of 60-64, CPP can be applied for at a lowered rate. And for ages below 60, if working the amount of CPP you get after retirement will be impacted. Canada Old Age Security depends on the age as well as the annual individual income. If above 65 years old, they can apply for OAS pension or OAS guaranteed income supplement. If under 65 years old, they can apply for OAS Allowance, or OAS Allowance for the Survivor if their partner has passed away. No application is needed for prescription drugs for patients above 65 years old, but an application is needed for the Ontario Trillium Drug Program for patients under 65 years old.

Financial resources for energy, housing and utilities, veteran-specific programs, disability-specific programs, community services, and discounts, are shared between older adults above or below the age of 65.

Energy resources are available for older adults like Ontario Electricity Support Program (OESP), Low-Income Energy Assistance Program (LEAP), and Affordability option for those not eligible for OESP or LEAP. Region of Waterloo provides housing and utilities help with paying rent, and utility bill help. Ontario Renovates is also used to help with older adults with financial needs. Financial support for older adults with disabilities is covered under two categories, income security and tax credits. CPP Disabilities benefits, and Disability savings grant come under income security, while Ontario Home and Vehicle Modification, and Disability Tax credit come under tax credit resources. Veteran resources are only applicable if you have a medical condition or disability and are able to prove it is related to your Canadian military service. Programs like Veterans Disability Pension and Disability Award, Ontario Soldiers Aid Commission, and Grand River Transit Veterans Transit Pass (ages 65+) are available to the older adult public.
